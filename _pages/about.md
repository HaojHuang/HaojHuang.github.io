## About me:
* I'm a PhD student in [Khoury Collge of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/haojie-huang/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu), where I am advised by
[Prof. Platt](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/) in [The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/).

* I am super interested in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and their applications in robotics, image processing, point cloud analyses, and other related fields.

* Stay fool and stay hungry!
