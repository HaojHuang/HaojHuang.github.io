## About me
* I'm a PhD student in [Khoury Collge of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu), where I am advised by
[Prof. Platt](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/) in [The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/).

## News
* **05/2022**: Spotlight presentation of [Equivariant Transporter Network](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jamVpGcn_C1xeoWgxqXI3KtDxpOohYHW/view) (Best Paper Award Finalists) on [Scaling Robot Learning Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/icra22-srl) of [ICRA-2022](https://www.icra2022.org/program/awards).
* **04/2022**: Our work on [Equivariant Transporter Network](https://haojhuang.github.io/etp_page/) is accepted at [RSS 2022](https://roboticsconference.org/).
* **10/2021**: Our work on [GASCN: Graph Attention Shape Completion Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07937) is accepted at [3DV 2021](https://3dv2021.surrey.ac.uk/).
